# docker-ha-bridge
From https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge:
"Docker image containing home automation bridge that emulates a Philips Hue light system and can control other systems such as a Vera, Harmony Hub, Nest, MiLight bulbs or any other system that has an http/https/tcp/udp interface. This is a compact impl to run on small format computers."

This image will provide a cross-platform docker image containing the ha-bridge software. Planned to support amd64 and arm32v7 architectures.
